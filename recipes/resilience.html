    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start with self-compassion.</strong> This forms your base. Stir gently but thoroughly—no room for harsh self-talk here.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in grit and adaptability.</strong> These are your structure—what helps you bend without breaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle in humor.</strong> Even a little can change the flavor of the toughest moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Add perspective slowly.</strong> Best when simmered over time. Helps you see beyond the moment.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk in vulnerability.</strong> It might feel counterintuitive, but it binds the rest together.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix in stubborn hope.</strong> Even a small amount can go a long way. Let it rise, even when it doesn’t feel like it will.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish with support.</strong> Friends, family, pets, therapists—whatever works. Don't skimp on this step.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it sit.</strong> Resilience builds over time. Don’t rush it.</li>
    </ol>
